    %title Introduction

    %para
      Fabric has traditionally provided access to parallelism through use of of its dependency graph to structure computation and data. However, the dependency graph has several shortcomings, especially when used for server-side computation:

    %itemizedlist
      %listitem
        %para
          Constructing dependency graphs takes a lot of code. Even the simplest dependency graph requires the creation and connection of several different objects.
      %listitem
        %para
          Since the data in the dependency graph is persistent, it tends to incur a heavy memory overhead.
      %listitem
        %para
          Dependency graphs cannot be created or modified from within KL itself.

    %para
      To solve these problems, Fabric provides a separate model of parallel programming called "Map-Reduce" that is inspired by models of parallelism provided by functional programming languages and commercial MapReduce frameworks for large-scale computing. The map-reduce functionality is available both within KL and from the host language such as JavaScript or Python. It is simple to use, provides highly-parallel performance and incurs a minimal memory overhead.

    %section
      %title Background

      %para Traditionally, the map-reduce paradigm provides a simple way of performing parallel operations on large sets of data. The input to map-reduce is a large array of data whose elements are of a common type, and the output is a single value of another type. The output is produced from the input by performing the following steps:

      %itemizedlist
        %listitem
          %para
            For each input element <code>Xi</code> in the input array <code>[x1,x2,...xn]</code>, the value <code>mi = map(xi)</code> is computed. This can be done for the input elements in parallel.
        %listitem
          %para
            The result <code>R = reduce([M1,M2,...,Mn])</code> is computed by combining the results of the map operations.

      %para
        The canonical example of a map-reduce operation is to count the number of occurrences of a given word in a large set of documents (for simplicity, strings). Then the <code>map(Xi)</code> operation counts the number of occurrences of the word in the string <code>Xi</code>, and the <code>reduce([M1,M2,...,Mn])</code> operation simply sums the results of all the <code>Mi</code>.

      %para
        There are several problems with map-reduce in its simplest form:

      %itemizedlist
        %listitem
          %para
            The individual <code>Xi</code> themselves might be values that need to be computed and/or that take a lot of memory. As such, it makes sense to retrieve (or compute) the value <code>Xi</code> right before computing <code>map(Xi)</code> and then to immediately throw away the value of <code>Xi</code>.
        %listitem
          %para
            Instead of computing <code>reduce([M1,M2,...,Mn])</code> once all the <code>Mi</code> are computed, we use less memory and make better use of parallelism by accumulating the result. First we initialize <code>R</code> to a default value, and then as each <code>Mi</code> is computed we compute <code>R = reduce(R, Mi)</code>. Once this is done for all the <code>Mi</code>, we return the resulting <code>R</code>. We must use a mutex to guarantee that <code>reduce(R, Mi)</code> is only ever executed by one thread at a time.

      %para
        Fabric addresses these issues as well as others to provide a more general framework for parallel computation inspired by the traditional map-reduce case.

    %section
      %title Concepts

      %para
        Map-reduce in Fabric has a more generic and powerful implementation that arises from a core set of concepts and operations. The traditional map-reduce case is then just a specific case of what can be done with the Fabric map-reduce framework. All of the concepts and operations are available both within KL programs and are accessible using the host language interface to the Fabric core.

      %section
        %title Producers

        %para
          The first concept is the notion of a <emphasis>producer</emphasis>. A producer is a first-class object whose methods can be used to produce scalar and vector values; these values can be any of the core types in Fabric, and registered (user-defined) types, or even more producers.

        %para
          There are two classes of producers in Fabric, described below.

        %section
          %title Value Producers

          %para
            A <emphasis>value producer</emphasis> is a producer that can produce a scalar value; it has the method <code>produce()</code> that returns the value, as well as the method <code>flush()</code> that flushes any cached values (see the 'Caches' section below).

        %section
          %title Array Producers

          %para
            An <emphasis>array producer</emphasis> is a producer that can produce an array (vector) of elements; it has five methods:

          %itemizedlist
            %listitem
              %para
                <code>getCount()</code>: returns the number of elements in the array
            %listitem
              %para
                <code>produce(index)</code>: returns the element of the array with index <code>index</code> 
            %listitem
              %para
                <code>produce(startIndex, count)</code>: returns the subarray of <code>count</code> elements of the array starting with index <code>startIndex</code> 
            %listitem
              %para
                <code>produce()</code>: returns the array of all elements
            %listitem
              %para
                <code>flush()</code>: flushes any cached values (see the 'Caches' section below).

          %para
            The indices are zero-based, as in KL. All the the array elements have the same type; in a strong sense, an array producer is an object that can be used to populate a variable-length KL array.

          %para
            Note that an array producer specifies how to produce the elements of an array without actually producing them. This means that you can create an array produce for an array with billions of elements and it takes no more memory than an array producer for one element; it's only when the elements are produced that the results may be stored, depending on how the results are used.

          %para
            The <code>produce()</code> and <code>produce(startIndex, count)</code> methods produce the individual elements of the array in parallel.

      %section
        %title Types of Producers

        %para
          For each class (value or array) of producer, there are four basic types of producers that produce values in different ways.

        %section
          %title Constant Producers

          %para
            A constant producer has fixed values that are produced. It does not need to execute any code to produce its values, and the values it produces are specified when the constant producer is created.

        %section
          %title Generators

          %para
            A generator is a producer that calls a function to produce its value. In the case of an array producer, the function that is called can optionally receive the index within the array and the total number of elements of the array; these can be used to calculate the element to generate. Both value and array producers can optionally take a "shared value" which can be used to pass things like shared parameters to the generator. The shared value is itself the result of calling <code>produce()</code> on a value producer, which means that it can itself potentially be a calculated value.

        %section
          %title Maps

          %para
            A map is a producer that takes as input a value of one type and produces from it a value of another, potentially different, type. An example of a simple map might be one that takes a string as input and produces the length of the string as output. As with generators, an array map can optionally take the index of the element being produced as well as the count of the array, and both value and array maps can take a shared value.

        %section
          %title Transforms

          %para
            A transform is a producer that modifies the value of another producer. The same behaviour could be accomplished using a map that uses the same type for input and output, but using a transform instead will require less memory and generally result in slightly better runtime performance. An example of a simple transform might be one that normalizes a vector. As with generators and maps, an array transform can optionally take the index of the element being produced as well as the count of the array, and both value and array transforms can take a shared value.

      %section
        %title Reduce

        %para
          The reduce operation is the bridge between array producers and value producers. A reduce operation takes an array producer and a function as input and returns a value producer as output. The reduce operation works by calling the function for each element produced by the array producer; this function is then used to progressively produce the result of reduce operation as a value producer. There are two guarantees for the function:

        %itemizedlist
          %listitem
            %para
              The function is called exactly once for each element of the input array producer; and
          %listitem
            %para
              The function is called by only one thread at a time so that no manual synchronization is necessary.

        %para
          However, the order in which the elements of the array producer is undefined, and as such algorithms cannot depend on this order.

        %para
          As with generators, maps and transforms, the reduce function can optionally take the index of element of the input array producer as well as its total count, and you can optionally pass a shared value.

        %para
          A simple example of a reduce operation would be to sum an array of values. The array producer would produce the individual values, and the reduce function would simply add each value to the result.

      %section
        %title Caches

        %para
          A cache is a producer that simply caches the value of another producer. Caches are a simple solution for situations where the same results would be computed multiple times. As an example, if multiple producers all used the same shared value producer, it would probably make sense to put a value cache in front of the value producer so that it's not recomputed every time it's used.

        %para
          All producers support a method called <code>flush()</code> that recursively flushes any caches. So, for example, if you have a reduce operation that uses a shared value that is cached, calling <code>flush()</code> on the reduce operation will flush the connected shared value cache.

      %section
        %title Composing Producers and Reduce Operations

        %para
          The power of Fabric's map-reduce model is found through the use of composition. Maps, transforms and reduce operations all take other producers as input and allow modification of the results. As well, generators, maps, transforms and reduce operations all optionally take shared values that are the results of the <code>produce()</code> operation of a value producer; this value produce can in turn be a complex, composed operation such as a reduce operation on a map.

        %para
          As an example, suppose you had a large set of documents and you wanted to count the occurrence of the longest word that occurs across all the documents; assume for the example that there is a unique longest word. You need to first figure out what this word is and then count it. The compositional model would be:

        %programlisting(language='kl')<
          :cdata
            reduce(
              input: map(
                input: constArray(documents),
                function: countWord,
                sharedValue: reduce(
                  input: map(
                    input: constArray(documents),
                    function: findLongestWord
                    ),
                  function: pickLongestWord
                ),
              function: sumValue
              )

        %para
          Then the functions would look something like:

        %programlisting(language='kl')<
          :cdata
            operator findLongestWord(String document, io String longestWord) {
              // Set longestWord to the longest word in document
            }

            operator pickLongestWord(String word, io String longestWord) {
              if (word.length > longestWord.length)
                longestWord = word;
            }

            operator countWord(String document, io Size count, String word) {
              // Set count to the number of occurrences of word in document
            }

            operator sumValue(Size count, io Size totalCount) {
              totalCount += count;
            }

    %title KL Implementation

    %para
      As mentioned previously, the map-reduce model is available both directly in KL and directly from JavaScript or Python. Using the map-reduce model directly from within KL allows for simple multithreading directly from within KL itself, without the need to create structures within the host language.

    %section
      %title KL Constant Producers

      %para
        In KL, a constant value producer is created using the <code>createConstValue(value)</code> call. The value parameter can be any typed KL r-value, eg. a constant value, the value of a variable, or the result of a function call. The result of the value is a value of type <code>ValueProducer&lt;ValueType&gt;</code>, where <code>ValueType</code> is the type of <code>value</code>. For example, the KL code:

      %programlisting(language='kl')<
        :cdata
          operator entry() {
            ValueProducer<Scalar> vp = createConstValue(1.4142);
            report vp.produce();
          }

      %para
        produces the result:

      %screen<
        :cdata
          1.4142

      %para
        A constant array producer is created using the <code>createConstArray(array)</code> function. Its single parameter array must be an expression that resolves to a fixed-length, variable-length or sliced array. The return value is of type <code>ArrayProducer&lt;ElementType&gt;</code>, where <code>ElementType</code> is the type of the array elements. For example, the KL code:

      %programlisting(language='kl')<
        :cdata
          operator entry() {
            String a[];
            a.push('zero'); a.push('one'); a.push('two');
            ArrayProducer<String> ap = createConstArray(a);
            report ap.produce();
          }

      %para
        produces the result:

      %screen<
        :cdata
          ["zero","one","two"]

    %section
      %title KL Generators

      %para
        A value generator in KL is created using the <code>createValueGenerator(functionName)</code>. <code>functionName</code> must be the name of a KL function available in the same KL module that has the signature operator <code>functionName(io ValueType value);</code> the result is a value of type <code>ValueProducer&lt;ValueType&gt;</code>. For example, the KL code:

      %programlisting(language='kl')<
        :cdata
          operator gen(io String value[]) {
            value.push("Hello, world!");
          }

          operator entry() {
            ValueProducer<String[]>vp = createValueGenerator(gen);
            report vp.produce();
          }

      %para
        produces the output:

      %screen<
        :cdata
          ["Hello, world!"]

      %para
        An array generator in KL is created using the <code>createArrayGenerator(countValueProducer, functionName)</code>. The <code>countValueProducer</code> parameter must be a value producer that produces a value of type <code>Size</code>, ie. a value of type <code>ValueProducer&lt;Size&gt;</code>. If you are generating a fixed-size array of size 16, for instance, you can pass the result of <code>createConstValue(16)</code>, but you can also pass a more complex value producer such as a value generator. The functionName is the name of a function in the same module with one of the following prototypes:

      %itemizedlist
        %listitem
          %para
            %code operator functionName(io ElementType element)
        %listitem
          %para
            %code operator functionName(io ElementType element, Size index)
        %listitem
          %para
            %code operator functionName(io ElementType element, Size index, Size count)

      %para
        In cases where the index parameter is present, the index of the element within the array is passed to the generator function; similarly, when the count parameter is present the total number of elements in the array is passed. This can be useful for figuring out what value to generate.

      %para
        An example of an array generator:

      %programlisting(language="kl")<
        :cdata
          operator gen(
            io Scalar v,
            Size i,
            Size n
            )
          {
            // Produces n uniform values on the interval [0,1], including 0 and 1 themselves
            v = Scalar(i) / Scalar(n-1);
          }

          operator entry() {
            ArrayProducer<Scalar> ap = createArrayGenerator(createConstValue(Size(10)), gen);
            report ap.produce();
          }

      %para
        produces:

      %screen<
        :cdata
          [0,0.1111111,0.2222222,0.3333333,0.4444444,0.5555556,0.6666667,0.7777778,0.8888889,1]

      %para
        In both cases, you can optionally specify a shared value producer as the last parameter to the <code>create...Generator()</code> call. When a shared value producer is provided, the function receives an additional parameter whose type is the value type of the shared value producer. So, for value generators, the prototype of the operator becomes:

      %programlisting(language="kl")<
        :cdata
          operator gen(io ValueType value, SharedType sharedValue) {
            ...
          }

      %para
        and for array generators the prototype of the operator becomes:

      %programlisting(language="kl")<
        :cdata
          operator gen(io ElementType element, Size index, Size count, SharedType sharedValue) {

            ...
          }

      %para
        Note that when using a shared value with an array generator you must include the index and count parameters in the operator even if they are unused.

    %section
      %title KL Maps

      %para
        A value map in KL is created using the <code>createValueMap(inputValueProducer, functionName)</code>. <code>inputValueProducer</code> must be a value producer, and <code>functionName</code> must be the name of a KL function available in the same KL module that has the signature operator <code>functionName(InputType input, io OutputType output);</code> the type <code>InputType</code> must be the same as the value type of the input value producer. The result of the <code>createValueMap</code> call is a value of type <code>ValueProducer&lt;OutputType&gt;</code>. For example, the KL code:

      %programlisting(language="kl")<
        :cdata
          operator map(String input, io Size output) {
            output = input.length;
          }

          operator entry() {
            ValueProducer<Size> vp = createValueMap(createConstValue("Hello, world!"), map);
            report vp.produce();
          }

      %para
        produces the output:

      %screen<
        :cdata
          13

      %para
        An array map in KL is created using the <code>createArrayMap(inputArrayProducer, functionName)</code>. The <code>inputArrayProducer</code> parameter must be an array producer. Assuming that the element type of <code>inputArrayProducer</code> is <code>InputType</code>, <code>functionName</code> is the name of a function in the same module with one of the following prototypes:

      %itemizedlist
        %listitem
          %para
            %code operator functionName(InputType input, io OutputType output)
        %listitem
          %para
            %code operator functionName(InputType input, io OutputType output, Size index)
        %listitem
          %para
            %code operator functionName(InputType input, io OutputType output, Size index, Size count)

      %para
        In cases where the <code>index</code> parameter is present, the index of the element within the array is passed to the generator function; similarly, when the count parameter is present the total number of elements in the array is passed. The result of the <code>createArrayMap</code> call is a value of type <code>ArrayProducer&lt;OutputType&gt;</code>.

      %para
        An example of an array map:

      %programlisting(language="kl")<
        :cdata
          operator map(String input, io Size output) {
            output = input.length;
          }

          operator entry() {
            String a[]; a.push("one"); a.push("two"); a.push("three");
            ArrayProducer<String> iap = createConstArray(a);
            report iap.produce();
            ArrayProducer<Size> oap = createArrayMap(iap, map);
            report oap.produce();
          }

      %para
        produces:

      %screen<
        :cdata
          ["one","two","three"]
          [3,3,5]

      %para
        In both cases, you can optionally specify a shared value producer as the last parameter to the <code>create...Map()</code> call. When a shared value producer is provided, the function receives an additional parameter whose type is the value type of the shared value producer. So, for value maps, the prototype of the operator becomes:

      %programlisting(language="kl")<
        :cdata
          operator gen(InputType input, io OutputType output, SharedType sharedValue) {
            ...
          }

      %para
        and for array maps the prototype of the operator becomes:

      %programlisting(language="kl")<
        :cdata
          operator gen(InputType input, io OutputType output, Size index, Size count, SharedType sharedValue) {
            ...
          }

      %para
        Note that when using a shared value with an array map you must include the <code>index</code> and <code>count</code> parameters in the operator even if they are unused.

        A value transform in KL is created using the <code>createValueTransform(inputValueProducer, functionName)</code>. <code>inputValueProducer</code> must be a value producer, and <code>functionName</code> must be the name of a KL function available in the same KL module that has the signature operator <code>functionName(io ValueType value)</code>; the type <code>ValueType</code> must be the same as the value type of the input value producer. The result of the <code>createValueMap</code> call is a value of type <code>ValueProducer&lt;ValueType&gt;</code>. For example, the KL code:

      %programlisting(language="kl")<
        :cdata
          operator transform(io Scalar value) {
            value = sqrt(value);
          }

          operator entry() {
            ValueProducer<Scalar> vp = createValueTransform(createConstValue(Scalar(3.14)), transform);
            report vp.produce();
          }

      %para
        produces the output:

      %screen<
        :cdata
          1.772004

      %para
        An array transform in KL is created using the <code>createArrayTransform(inputArrayProducer, functionName)</code>. The <code>inputArrayProducer</code> parameter must be an array producer. Assuming that the element type of <code>inputArrayProducer</code> is <code>ElementType</code>, <code>functionName</code> is the name of a function in the same module with one of the following prototypes:

      %itemizedlist
        %listitem
          %para
            %code operator functionName(io ElementType element)
        %listitem
          %para
            %code operator functionName(io ElementType element, Size index)
        %listitem
          %para
            %code operator functionName(io ElementType element, Size index, Size count)

      %para
        In cases where the <code>index</code> parameter is present, the index of the element within the array is passed to the generator function; similarly, when the <code>count</code> parameter is present the total number of elements in the array is passed. The result of the <code>createArrayTransform</code> call is a value of type <code>ArrayProducer&lt;ElementType&gt;</code>.

      %para
        An example of an array transform:

      %programlisting(language="kl")<
        :cdata
          operator transform(io Scalar value) {
            value = sqrt(value);
          }

          operator entry() {
            Scalar ia[]; ia.push(3.14); ia.push(2.71); ia.push(10.0); ia.push(87.32);
            ArrayProducer<Scalar> iap = createConstArray(ia);
            report iap.produce();
            ArrayProducer<Scalar> oap = createArrayTransform(iap, transform);
            report oap.produce();
          }

      %para
        produces:

      %screen<
        :cdata
          [3.14,2.71,10,87.32]
          [1.772004,1.646208,3.162278,9.344517]

      %para
        In both cases, you can optionally specify a shared value producer as the last parameter to the <code>create...Transform()</code> call. When a shared value producer is provided, the function receives an additional parameter whose type is the value type of the shared value producer. So, for value maps, the prototype of the operator becomes:

      %programlisting(language="kl")<
        :cdata
          operator gen(io ValueType value, SharedType sharedValue) {
            ...
          }

      %para
        and for array maps the prototype of the operator becomes:

      %programlisting(language="kl")<
        :cdata
          operator gen(io ElementType element, Size index, Size count, SharedType sharedValue) {
            ...
          }

      %para
        Note that when using a shared value with an array map you must include the <code>index</code> and <code>count</code> parameters in the operator even if they are unused.

    %section
      %title KL Reduce Operations

      %para
        To create a reduce operation in KL, use the <code>createReduce(inputArrayProducer, functionName)</code> call. <code>inputArrayProducer</code> must be an array producer; assume its element type is <code>InputType</code>. <code>functionName</code> must be the name of a function in the same module with one of the prototypes:

      %itemizedlist
        %listitem
          %para
            %code operator functionName(InputType input, io OutputType output)
        %listitem
          %para
            %code operator functionName(InputType input, io OutputType output, Size index)
        %listitem
          %para
            %code operator functionName(InputType input, io OutputType output, Size index, Size count)

      %para
        The result of the <code>createReduce</code> call is a value producer with value type <code>OutputType</code>, ie. a result of type <code>ValueProducer&lt;OutputType&gt;</code>. An example of using a reduce operation in KL:

      %programlisting(language="kl")<
        :cdata
          operator generate(io Size value, Size index) {
            value = index + 1;
          }

          operator reduce(Size input, io Size output) {
            output += input;
          }

          operator entry() {
            // Report the sum 1+2+...+99+100
            ValueProducer<Size> vp = createReduce(
              createArrayGenerator(
                createConstValue(Size(100)),
                generate
              ),
              reduce
            );
            report vp.produce();
          }

      %para
        This produces the result:

      %screen<
        :cdata
          5050

      %para
        You can optionally specify a shared value producer as the last parameter to the <code>createReduce()</code> call. When a shared value producer is provided, the function receives an additional parameter whose type is the value type of the shared value producer. The prototype of the operator becomes:

      %programlisting(language="kl")<
        :cdata
          operator reduce(InputType input, io OutputType output, Size index, Size count, SharedType sharedValue) {
            ...
          }

      %para
        Note that when using a shared value with an array map you must include the <code>index</code> and <code>count</code> parameters in the operator even if they are unused.

    %section
      %title KL Caches

      %para
        A value cache is created in KL using the <code>createValueCache(inputValueProducer)</code> call. The element type of the resulting value producer is the same as that of <code>inputValueProducer</code>. Example usage of a value cache in KL:

      %programlisting(language="kl")<
        :cdata
          operator gen(io String output) {
            report "  Running generator!";
            output = "Hello";
          }

          operator entry() {
            // test caching ValueGenerator
            ValueProducer<String> vp1 = createValueCache(createValueGenerator(gen));
            report "vp1 = " + vp1;
                    
            report "Should run generator";
            report "vp1.produce() = " + vp1.produce();
                        
            report "Should not run generator (use cache)";
            report "vp1.produce() = " + vp1.produce();
                            
            vp1.flush();
            report "Should run generator";
            report "vp1.produce() = " + vp1.produce();
          }
      
      %para
        resulting in:

      %screen<
        :cdata
          vp1 = ValueProducer<String>
          Should run generator
            Running generator!
          vp1.produce() = Hello
          Should not run generator (use cache)
          vp1.produce() = Hello
          Should run generator
            Running generator!
          vp1.produce() = Hello

      %para
        Similarly, an array cache is created using the <code>createArrayProducer(inputArrayProducer)</code> call. The resulting array producer has the same element type as <code>inputArrayProducer</code>. Example usage:

      %programlisting(language="kl")<
        :cdata
          operator generator(
            io Integer value
            )
          {
            report "  Running generator";
            value = 42;
          }
          
          operator entry() {
            // Generator caching
            ValueProducer<Size> cvg = createConstValue(Size(10));
            ArrayProducer<Integer> gen = createArrayCache(
              createArrayGenerator(cvg, generator)
              );
          
            report gen;
            report " gen.getCount() = " + gen.getCount();
          
            report "Should run generator 10x";
            for (Size i=0; i<10; ++i)
              report " gen.produce() = " + gen.produce(i);
          
            report "Should not run generator (cached)";
            for (Size i=0; i<10; ++i)
              report " gen.produce() = " + gen.produce(i);
          
            gen.flush();
            report "Should run generator 10x";
            for (Size i=0; i<10; ++i)
              report " gen.produce() = " + gen.produce(i);
          }

      %para
        resulting in:

      %screen<
        :cdata
          ArrayProducer<Integer>
           gen.getCount() = 10

    %title Scripting Language Implementations (JavaScript/Python)

    %para
      All of the map-reduce functionality that is available directly in KL is also available from JavaScript and Python. Syntax between JavaScript and Python is nearly identical and therefore most examples will be given in JavaScript, unless there the corresponding Python implementation would be unclear.

    %section
      %title Creating a <code>client</code> object

      %para
        Creating a <code>client</code> object does differ between JavaScript and Python so we will describe it here once and then leave it out of further examples.

      %para
        In JavaScript:

      %programlisting(language="javascript")<
        :cdata
          var client = require('Fabric').createClient();

      %para
        And in Python:

      %programlisting(language="python")<
        :cdata
          import fabric
          client = fabric.createClient()

      %para
        The client object is the base from which the rest of the Map Reduce objects are created.

    %section
      %title Compilation of KL Code

      %para
        In order to provide the KL code used for operators for map-reduce operations, a generic KL compilation framework has been provided.

      %para
        For simple examples, functions for compiling operators directly have been provided:

      %itemizedlist
        %listitem
          %para
            %code client.KLC.createValueGeneratorOperator
        %listitem
          %para
            %code client.KLC.createValueMapOperator
        %listitem
          %para
            %code client.KLC.createValueTransformOperator
        %listitem
          %para
            %code client.KLC.createArrayGeneratorOperator
        %listitem
          %para
            %code client.KLC.createArrayMapOperator
        %listitem
          %para
            %code client.KLC.createArrayTransformOperator
        %listitem
          %para
            %code client.KLC.createReduceOperator

      %para
        Each of these functions take the parameters <code>sourceName</code>, <code>sourceCode</code>, <code>operatorName</code>. <code>sourceName</code> is the name of the source file to display when a compilation error occurs, <code>sourceCode</code> is the actual KL source code, and <code>operatorName</code> is the name of the operator that should result from the call. For example:

      %programlisting(language="javascript")<
        :cdata
          > var reduce = client.KLC.createReduceOperator('reduce.kl', 'operator reduce(Size input, io Size output) { output += input; }', 'reduce');
          > console.log(reduce.toJSON());

      %para
        results in:

      %screen<
        :cdata
          { kind: 'ReduceOperator',
            entryName: 'reduce',
            ast: 
             [ { '+': 'Operator',
                 returnExprType: '',
                 body: [Object],
                 friendlyName: 'reduce',
                 entryName: 'reduce',
                 params: [Object] } ] }

      %para
        which is a JSON representation of the operator. This operator can then be passed to a call to <code>client.MR.createReduce(...)</code> as the operator parameter.

      %para
        For more complex examples, it will make more sense to include one or more KL 'source files' into a single compilation unit and to then resolve the operators within. This is done using the <code>client.KLC.createCompilation()</code>, <code>compilation.addSourceFile(sourceName, sourceCode)</code>, <code>compilation.run()</code> and <code>executable.resolve...Operator()</code> functions. For example:

      %programlisting(language="javascript")<
        :cdata
          > var compilation = fabricClient.KLC.createCompilation();
          > compilation.addSource('generate.kl', 'operator generate(io Size value, Size index) { value = index + 1; }');
          > compilation.addSource('reduce.kl', 'operator reduce(Size input, io Size output) { output += input; }');
          > var executable = compilation.run();
          > var reduce = executable.resolveReduceOperator('reduce');
          > reduce.toJSON();

      %para
        results in:

      %screen<
        :cdata
          { kind: 'ReduceOperator',
            entryName: 'reduce',
            ast: 
             [ { '+': 'Operator',
                 returnExprType: '',
                 body: [Object],
                 friendlyName: 'generate',
                 entryName: 'generate',
                 params: [Object] },
               { '+': 'Operator',
                 returnExprType: '',
                 body: [Object],
                 friendlyName: 'reduce',
                 entryName: 'reduce',
                 params: [Object] } ] }

      %para
        Note that the AST in the JSON representation in this case is larger; this is because the two "source files" we combined in a single compilation unit. Similarly, we could call:

      %programlisting(language="javascript")<
        :cdata
          > var generate = executable.resolveArrayGeneratorOperator('generate');
          > generate.toJSON();

      %para
        which results in:

      %screen<
        :cdata
          { kind: 'ArrayGeneratorOperator',
            entryName: 'generate',
            ast: 
             [ { '+': 'Operator',
                 returnExprType: '',
                 body: [Object],
                 friendlyName: 'generate',
                 entryName: 'generate',
                 params: [Object] },
               { '+': 'Operator',
                 returnExprType: '',
                 body: [Object],
                 friendlyName: 'reduce',
                 entryName: 'reduce',
                 params: [Object] } ] }

    %section
      %title Asynchronous Production

      %para
        In addition to the usual <code>produce()</code> methods on value and array producers, the JavaScript and Python bindings also support <code>produceAsync(callback)</code> methods. <code>produceAsync(callback)</code> causes the produce operation to happen asynchronously (ie. in the background); when the operation is complete, the function callback is called, passing the result of the <code>produce()</code> operation as the first parameter. This is very useful for servicing computation in the background without blocking the main thread.

      %para
        For example, in JavaScript:

      %programlisting(language="javascript")<
        :cdata
          var cv = client.MR.createConstValue('Size', 42);
          cv.produceAsync(function (result) {
            console.log("Result is " + result);
            fabricClient.close();
          });
          console.log("Waiting for result...");

      %para
        And in Python, since the syntax is slightly different:

      %programlisting(language="python")<
        :cdata
          cv = client.MR.createConstValue('Size', 42);
          def callback(result):
            print 'Result is ' + result
            client.close()
          cv.produceAsync(callback)
          print 'Waiting for result...'

      %para
        will both produce:

      %screen<
        :cdata
          Waiting for result...
          Result is 42

      %para
        Python programmers may ask how it is that the Python example doesn't simply exit immediately when it hits the end of file. This is because the Fabric Python module waits for all its clients to close before allowing the script to exit. If more control is required over when the clients will exit, the user can use the Fabric client's <code>running()</code> method to both test whether or not the client object is still running, as well as to service any pending actions.

      %programlisting(language="python")<
        :cdata
          cv = client.MR.createConstValue('Size', 42);
          def callback(result):
            print 'Result is ' + result
            client.close()
          cv.produceAsync(callback)
          print 'Waiting for result...'

      %title Using a Single Fabric Client for Multiple Computations

      %para
        Unlike the dependency graph, it is safe to use a single Fabric client for multiple computations, as long as you create separate producers and reduce operations for each computation. In this way, the operators can be shared between the computations. A simple Node.js HTTP server to generate the Fibonacci numbers might look like:

      %programlisting(language="javascript")<
        :cdata
          fabric = require('Fabric');
          http = require('http');
          fs = require('fs');

          var fabricClient = fabric.createClient();

          var fibonacciGeneratorOperator = fabricClient.KLC.createValueGeneratorOperator(
            "fibonacci-mr.kl",
            fs.readFileSync("fibonacci-mr.kl", "utf8"),
            "fibonacci"
          );

          http.createServer(function (req, res) {
            var fibonacciGenerator = fabricClient.MR.createValueGenerator(
              fibonacciGeneratorOperator,
              fabricClient.MR.createConstValue('Integer', 40)
            );
            res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
            res.end("\n"+fibonacciGenerator.produce()+"\n");
          }).listen(1337, "127.0.0.1");

      %title Constant Producers

      %para
        In JavaScript and Python, a constant value producer is created using the <code>client.MR.createConstValue(typeName, value)</code> call. The <code>typeName</code> parameter is the name of the type of the value (eg. <code>Size</code>), and the <code>value</code> parameter is the value to use. The value is interpreted as the specified type; if no conversion is possible an error results. For example, the JavaScript code:

      %programlisting(language="javascript")<
        :cdata
          client.MR.createConstValue(
            'Scalar',
            1.4142
          ).produce();

      %para
        produces the result:

      %screen<
        :cdata
          1.414199948310852

      %para
        (since floating-point numbers are 64-bit in JavaScript)

      %para
        A constant array producer is created using the <code>client.MR.createConstArray(elementTypeName, array)</code> function. The <code>elementTypeName</code> parameter is the name of the element type of the resulting array producer, and the <code>array</code> parameter must be an array of values that can be casted to the specified element type. For example, the JavaScript code:

      %programlisting(language="javascript")<
        :cdata
          client.MR.createConstArray(
            'Scalar',
            [1.4142, 3.14159, 2.718281]
          ).produce();

      %para
        produces the result:

      %screen<
        :cdata
          [ 1.414199948310852,
            3.141590118408203,

    %section
      %title Generators

      %para
        A value generator in JavaScript or Python is created using the <code>client.MR.createValueGenerator(valueGeneratorOperator)</code>. <code>valueGeneratorOperator</code> must be a value generator operator returned from <code>client.KLC.createValueGeneratorOperator()</code> or <code>executable.resolveValueGeneratorOperator()</code>. For example, the JavaScript code:

      %para
        In both cases, you can optionally specify a shared value producer as the last parameter to the <code>client.MR.create...Generator()</code> call. When a shared value producer is provided, the operator receives an additional parameter whose type is the value type of the shared value producer, as in KL.

    %section
      %title Maps

      %para
        A value map in JavaScript or Python is created using the <code>client.MR.createValueMap(inputValueProducer, valueMapOperator)</code>. <code>inputValueProducer</code> must be a value producer, and <code>valueMapOperator</code> must be a value map operator returned from <code>client.KLC.createValueMapOperator()</code> or <code>executable.resolveValueMapOperator()</code>. For example, the JavaScript code:

      %programlisting(language="javascript")<

    %section
      %title Transforms

      %para
        A value transform in JavaScript or Python is created using the <code>client.MR.createValueTransform(inputValueProducer, valueTransformOperator)</code>. The type of the first parameter of the operator must be the value type of the input producer. For example:

    %section
      %title Reduce

      %para
        To create a reduce operation in JavaScript or Python, use the <code>client.MR.createReduce(inputArrayProducer, reduceOperator)</code> call. <code>inputArrayProducer</code> must be an array producer; assume its element type is <code>InputType</code>. <code>reduceOperator</code> must be a reduce operator with one of prototypes:

      %itemizedlist
        %listitem
          %para
            %code operator operatorName(InputType input, io OutputType output)
        %listitem
          %para
            %code operator operatorName(InputType input, io OutputType output, Size index)
        %listitem
          %para
            %code operator operatorName(InputType input, io OutputType output, Size index, Size count)

      %para
        The result of the <code>client.MR.createReduce(...)</code> call is a value producer with value type <code>OutputType</code>. For example:

      %programlisting(language="javascript")<
        :cdata
          client.MR.createReduce(
            client.MR.createConstArray(

          client.close();

      %para
        produces the result:

      %screen<
        :cdata
          12

      %para
        You can optionally specify a shared value producer as the last parameter to the <code>client.MR.createReduce()</code> call. When a shared value producer is provided, the function receives an additional parameter whose type is the value type of the shared value producer. The prototype of the operator becomes:

      %programlisting(language="kl")<
        :cdata
          operator reduce(InputType input, io OutputType output, Size index, Size count, SharedType sharedValue) {
            ...
          }

      %para
        Note that when using a shared value with an array map you must include the <code>index</code> and <code>count</code> parameters in the operator even if they are unused.

    %section
      %title Caches

      %para
        To create a value cache in JavaScript or Python, use the <code>client.MR.createValueCache(inputValueProducer)</code> call. The value type of the cache is the same as the value type of <code>inputValueProducer</code>. Example usage:

      %programlisting(language="javascript")<
        :cdata
          var gen = 
            client.MR.createValueCache(
